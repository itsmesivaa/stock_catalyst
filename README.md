# Below were the steps to setup for Backend workflow EC2 instance 

# 1. Login with your AWS console and launch an EC2 instance

Run the following commands basic commands

    sudo apt-get update -y
    
    sudo apt-get upgrade

# Install Docker

    curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
    
    sudo sh get-docker.sh
    
    sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
    
    newgrp docker

# 3.Cloning Github repository project to EC2 instance

To Cloning private git repository need to generate token on Github 

    git clone https://<generatedtoken>@github.com/<your account or organization>/<repo>.git
    
# 4.Building Docker images 
Building Docker file on EC2 instance and moving images into Docker hub (For Backend workflow)

    docker build -f Dockerfile_webscrape -t itsmesivaa/webscrape:latest .

Building Docker file on EC2 instance and moving images into Docker hub (For Frontend workflow)

    docker build -f Dockerfile_stockcatalyst -t itsmesivaa/stockcatalyst:latest .

Checking listed images after successful build

    docker images -a  

Running docker images on EC2 instance all the time even after closing
Note: Running docker with -d will indefinetely run the container even after the instance close i.e, 24hours running on EC2 instance

# Backend docker workflow:

    docker run itsmesivaa/webscrape

# Frontend docker workflow:

    docker run -p 8501:8501 itsmesivaa/stockcatalyst

# To lists the containers running on your Docker host.

    docker ps

#Command to stop docker container

    docker stop container_id

#Deleting Docker containers

    docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)


# 5. Connect DockerHub

    docker login

# Moving built docker image to DockerHub
Backend docker file:

    docker push itsmesivaa/webscrape:latest

Fronend docker file:

    docker push itsmesivaa/stockcatalyst:latest

# Remove Docker images
Backend docker file:

    docker rmi itsmesivaa/webscrape:latest

Fronend docker file:

    docker rmi itsmesivaa/stockcatalyst:latest

# Pulling images from DockerHub

Backend docker file:

    docker pull itsmesivaa/webscrape
